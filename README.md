# Entropic Multisite integrative model

Simulate kinetic models of phosphorylation, dephosphorylation and effector molecule binding to disordered signaling modlecules. For a full description, see Clemens et al., "Intrinsic Disorder in the T Cell Receptor Creates Cooperativity and Controls ZAP70 Binding", Biophysical Journal 2021.

## Quickstart

These are standalone matlab scripts. Run any of the .m files to generate parameter explorations in each title.
